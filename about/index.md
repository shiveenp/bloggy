👋🏽 Hey, I'm [@Shiveen](https://twitter.com/shiveen_p), and welcome to my blog. I'm a polyglot cross-stack developer based in Melbourne. 

I blog about software and life in general. This website is a personal record of some TILs, nano product experiments with some life commentary mixed in.

When I'm not working behind a computer, I love going on bouldering, cooking and taking pictures. 

If you're a recruiter, my professional resume is [here](/resume) with a nicer, slightly abridged version [here](/resume).
