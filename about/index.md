👋🏽 Hey, I'm [@Shiveen](https://twitter.com/shiveen_p), and welcome to my blog. I'm a polyglot cross-stack developer based in [Melbourne](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Pages/home.aspx). 

I blog about software and life in general. This website is a personal record of some TILs, nano product experiments with some life commentary mixed in.

When I'm not working behind a computer, I love bouldering, badminton, cooking and taking pictures. 

If you're a recruiter, my professional resume is [here](https://read.cv/shiveenp) with a longer read [here](/resume).
