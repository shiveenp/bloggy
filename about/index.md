I'm Shiveen, a cross-stack developer during the week and a rock climber and coffee chaser during the weekends. I blog about software and life in general. This website is a personal record of some TILs, nano product experiments with some life commentary mixed in. Nothing here is meant to be taken too seriously.

When I'm not working behind a computer, I love going on hikes and trying new food. I also enjoy landscape photography and climbing things. 

If you're a recruiter, my professional resume is [here](/resume).
