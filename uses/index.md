Inspired by [others](https://uses.tech), this is just a broad overview of my setup and productivity tools. The list isn't exhaustive and only contains tools that are directly related to my work or daily productivity stack. 

I develop primarily in Java, Kotlin for backend and React, VueJs for frontend.

### Hardware

- [MacBook Pro 16](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro-16/)
    - 2.4GHz 8 core
    - 32GB DDR4 RAM
    - AMD Radeon Pro with 4GB DDR6 memory
    - 2 TB SSD

- [Dell U2720Q](https://www.amazon.com.au/Dell-UltraSharp-U2720Q-Monitor-Display/dp/B0849RW2R3): This monitor is the perfect size for me. Having tried both a larger (32") and an UltraWide monitors in the past, I find 27" to be the sweetspot when it comes to screen real estate and neck movement rquired when working.
- [Apple Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MJ2R2ZA/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver)
- [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MLA22ZA/A/magic-keyboard-us-english)
- [Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard): I use these with some cheap O-rings I got from Amazon
- [Logitech C922 Pro Webcam](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)

## Software

I have only listed main highlights here. For a more comprehensive listing - my dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/shiveenp/dotty). Feel free to copy anything you find interesting, as I have done from so many other amazing people out there.

### Development Tools

- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as my tool of choice for both back and front end work
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for general text editing needs, where I don't really need a heavy IDE
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) for developing in my primary database, postgres
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for hosting my side projects
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static site hosting, including this one
- [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for all my domain name needs
- Firefox as my browser for general web usage and personal dev and Safari on phone
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as my programming font
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for API testing
- [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/) for some nice looking ASCII diagrams

### Mac Apps 

I try to stick mostly stock mac apps, however, below are some notable additions to my stack:

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) for managing my logins and passwords
- [Bear](https://bear.app/) for general note taking and [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer) for the times I need to focus on writing technical docs of blogs
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) as acts as my main Get Shit Done tool 
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) probably the most used app in my toolkit, saves me so much time
- [StepTwo Authenticator](https://steptwo.app/) as my two step verification app. I really like the nice interface and native iCloud sync
- Apple Music for music streaming. I migrated away from Spotify after 6 years of using them since I find the apple music interface better. However, they're both great choices in my opinion.
- [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) for keeping an eye on my mac when under heavy load
- [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato) as my new replacement for ItsyCal, allows me to quickly join zoom meetings

### Gadgets/ Accessories

- [iPhone 11 Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11)
- [Canon EOS Mk50](https://www.canon.com.au/cameras/eos-m50) with [EF-M 18-150mm f/3.5-6.3](https://www.canon.com.au/camera-lenses/ef-m-18-150mm-f-3-5-6-3-is-stm) lens  
- [Yubikey 5ci](https://www.yubico.com/au/product/yubikey-5ci/)
- iPad Air 3rd Gen
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/au/apple-pencil/)
- [Airpods Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MWP22ZA/A/airpods-pro) and my trusty old Bose Quiet Comfort 35s to allow me to focus and work from home comfortably. I generally use Airpods Pro as a daily workhorse and only use the Bose when travelling or while the Airpods are charging.
