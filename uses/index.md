## Hardware

- Two MacBooks (13 and 16 inch) for personal and work respectively
- **LG 32UN880-B** as my main and only monitor
- **Apple Trackpad 2**
- **Keychron K3** Mechanical Keyboard upgraded to these recently from Keychron K2 and so far I like it
- **Logitech MX Master 2s**
- **Logitech C922 Pro Webcam**

## Software

- **IntelliJ IDEA** as my main IDE with **Jetbrains Mono** font and default **Darcula** theme
- **iTerm2**
- **Sublime Text** for general text editing needs, where I don't really need a heavy IDE
- **Chrome** as my main browser

### Mac Apps 

I try to stick mostly stock mac apps, however, below are some notable additions to my stack:

- **1Password** for managing my logins and passwords
- **Bear** for general note taking and **iAWriter** for the times I need to focus on writing technical docs of blogs
- **Things** acts as my main GSD tool 
- **Alfred** as spotlight replacement and handy clipboard but it does so much more I haven't yet explored it enough
- **Dato** for quickly jumping into remote meetings
