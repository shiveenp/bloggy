## Development

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - is my main IDE with Jetbrains Mono font. I stick to the default Darcula theme.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - is my terminal replacement, but I barely use 25% of its features. I run it with Oh My Zsh! and [Powerlevel 10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

## Services/Apps

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) for managing my logins and passwords
- Apple Notes for general note-taking and [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer) for the times I need to focus on writing technical docs or blogs
- [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) as my external brain as well one time notes
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) is my main GTD tool, and I find it has the perfect balance of extensibility and visibility
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) as spotlight replacement and handy clipboard but it does so much more I haven't yet explored it enough
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) for light editing of photos

## Camera
- Fujifilm X100V is my daily driver
- Canon EOS M50 MKII
